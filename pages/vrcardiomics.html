                  <p>Spatially resolved transcriptomics is an emerging class of high-throughput technologies that enable biologists to systematically investigate the expression of genes along with spatial information. Upon data acquisition, one major hurdle is the subsequent interpretation and visualization of the datasets acquired. To address this challenge, VR-Cardiomics is presented, which is a novel data visualization system with interactive functionalities designed to help biologists interpret spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets. By implementing the system in two separate immersive environments, fish tank virtual reality (FTVR) and head-mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR), biologists can interact with the data in novel ways not previously possible, such as visually exploring the gene expression patterns of an organ, and comparing genes based on their 3D expression profiles. Further, a biologist-driven use-case is presented, in which immersive environments facilitate biologists to explore and compare the heart expression profiles of different genes.</p>

   <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

   <p>VR-Cardiomics provides a framework to map multi-dimensional data (such as intensity and location of gene expression) onto 3D models in a heatmap-like manner. In our use case, the intensity is the level of gene expression of those expressed in the adult heart, and the location is this expression level in 18 discrete pieces of the heart as measured by RNA-seq.</p>

   <p>Code for the manuscript: Denis Bienroth<sup>*</sup>, Hieu T. Nim, Dimitar Garkov, Karsten Klein, Sabrina Jaeger-Honz, Mirana Ramialison<sup>#</sup> and Falk Schreiber<sup>#</sup>. "Spatially-Resolved Transcriptomics in ImmersiveEnvironments" (<sup>*</sup>: first author; <sup>#</sup>: corresponding authors)</p>

   <p>VR-Cardiomics is designed to map user-generated data onto a user-specific 3D model. However, the data and the model must meet certain requirements. Please refer to chapter <a href="#custom">Upload Custom Data</a> for more information on how to use VR-Cardiomics as a framework for your own data and models on your local machine.</p>

   <p>This application supports VR devices as listed <a href="#dependencies">below</a>, our <a href="https://github.com/Ramialison-Lab/3DCardiomics">web application</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Ramialison-Lab/3DCardiomicsZSpace">zSpace</a> are available as well.</p>

   </video>
   <h3 id="changebetweenabsoluteandnormalizedexpressionvalues">Change between absolute and normalized expression values</h3>

   <p>VR-Cardiomics allows to present expression data either in absolute or in normalised values. Our example data is based on log2CPM values for absolute. If <a href="#custom">own datasets</a> is used, the absolute values will represent the uploaded values of the csv file. Toggle between Normalised or Absolute by using the <a href="#menu">menu panel (9)</a>.</p>

   <h3 id="howtousetheheatmapcomparison">How to use the heatmap comparison</h3>

   <p>The heatmap comparison is a useful feature to allow calculating the absolute differences of each piece of the object between two expression patterns. The feature will automatically calculate those differences and apply a new colourisation to the model regarding how big the differences in each selected piece are. To use the heatmap function just select an expression for two objects and then grab one model with the pink handle. Hold the pink handle onto the handle of a second heart model. Release the trigger Button to enable the heatmap feature.</p>

   <h3 id="piecewisecomparisongroupselection">Piecewise Comparison / Group Selection</h3>

   <p>The <em>piecewise comparison/ group selection</em> is a feature that allows to group a number of pieces of the object together in two groups. Based on those two groups a list of expression values is generated matching the pattern of the selected pieces. 
   To use this feature press the <em>group Selection</em> Button on the <a href="#menu">menu panel(10)</a>. All objects will be deleted except of one object. This object can be used to select the pieces of the first group. Just bring the controller at one piece and press the <em>A</em> button of the oculus controller to select the piece. The piece will be coloured to confirm the selection. continue with this step until all pieces of group 1 are selected. Now push the button of the <a href="#menu">menu panel(10)</a> again to confirm the first group and start selecting new pieces for group 2. If the selection is done just press the button of the <a href="#menu">menu panel(10)</a> again to confirm selection and start calculating the matching expression values. The results will be shown in the table below. 
   To deselect pieces from the selection just select them anew.</p>

   <h2 id="anamecustomuploadcustomdataa"><a name="custom">Upload custom data </a></h2>

   <p>VR-Cardiomics allows users to upload their own datasets or models. However, since VR-Cardiomics is still a work in progress, certain requirements of the datasets as well as the objects are expected.</p>

   <h3 id="uploaddatasets">Upload datasets</h3>

   <p>VR-Cardiomics allows to upload datasets in csv format. Either as csv or txt files. In order to switch between the datasets, please see chapter <a href="#switchDataset">Switch between datasets</a>. To use this feature, the datasets need to be pre-uploaded. Please follow the following instructions:</p>

   <p><strong>Change dataset in editor</strong></p>

   <ol>
   <li>Open VR-Cardiomics in the <a href="#runVR">Unity editor</a>.</li>

   <li>Navigate to <code>Assets\Resources</code></li>

   <li>press right click and select <em>Import New Asset</em></li>

   <li>Browse your local machine and select the dataset to be uploaded</li>
   </ol>

   <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79250095/135014485-b13facb0-ed8d-4046-932d-4d7052fc1bdd.png" alt="image" width="800px" /></p>

   <p><strong>Change dataset in Windows</strong></p>

   <ol>
   <li>Simply navigate to the gitub source code of <em>VR-Cardiomics</em>* on your local machine.</li>

   <li>Navigate to <code>..\VR-Cardiomics\Assets\Resources</code></li>

   <li>Copy the dataset into the directory</li>
   </ol>

   <p><strong>Customise valid names</strong></p>

   <p>In order to allow VR-Cardiomics to recognise the items of your dataset, please customise the file <em>valid_names.txt</em>. This file contains all valid names, which in our case match the example data of <em>fake_mouse_expression_data8</em>. the file contains all gene names of MGI version 9. If you want to run VR-Cardiomics as a framework for other datasets, please replace this file with a file containing all the items of your dataset. </p>

   <p><strong>Example files and structure of datasets</strong>
   This version of <em>VR-Cardiomics</em> comes with sample data to use. The dataset is stored in <code>Assets\Resources\fake_mouse_expression.txt</code>. A snippet of the dataset is shown here:
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79250095/135015941-16cef151-9b09-4a66-ad2a-860888ff798b.png" alt="image" width="800px"/></p>

   <p>Each line of a customised dataset must start with the items name, followed by exactly 18 expression values in csv format, due to the current limitations as explained below.
   Once the dataset and the <em>valid_names</em> are customised, open the file <code>Assets\Currentfile.txt</code> and replace the name with the filename of your dataset (without endings such as .txt) (blue frame) or select the <strong>ScriptHolder</strong> Object in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> tab and replace the name in the <em>CSV Name</em> field in the <em>Colour(Script)</em> in the <em>Inspector</em> tab (green frame).</p>

   <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79250095/135016348-44577ed7-4620-4b22-a2f8-a25257aa9dd2.png" alt="csvName" width="800px"/></p>

   <p><strong>Current limitations of the dataset</strong>
   VR-Cardiomics is a work in progress. We developed it to use it on a 18 section slices heart model. Therefore, currently only datasets and models with exactly 18 slices are able to be used within the environment. We will take care of this limitation and to allow variable datasets and models as soon as possible.</p>

   <h3 id="upload3dmodel">Upload 3D model</h3>

   <p>VR-Cardiomics uses a heart model which is sliced into 18 pieces. This object can be used with this GitHub code. The model can be viewed in <code>Assets/Resources</code> It is saved as a prefab in Unity. For more information on prefabs in Unity visit <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html">this site</a>. 
   To upload a heart model, follow these steps:</p>

   <ol>
   <li>Navigate to the folder <code>Assets/Resources</code> and press right click and select <em>Import New Asset</em>. </li>

   <li>Browse your local machine and select the model you wish to upload.</li>

   <li>Drag and Drop (green arrow) the model from the prefab folder to the <em>inspector</em> tab into the field <em>Model Prefab</em> of the <em>Object Manager (Script)</em>. The name of the object will be shown in the selection.</li>
   </ol>

   <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79250095/135017216-5566bd2b-db89-4d90-b73b-36d6dc532ab0.png" alt="selectObject" width="800px" /></p>

   <p><strong>Limitations to objects</strong></p>

   <p>VR-Cardiomics is a work in progress. We developed it to use it on a 18 section slices heart model. Therefore, currently only datasets and models with exactly 18 slices are able to be used within the environment. We will take care of this limitation and to allow variable datasets and models as soon as possible.</p>

   <p>Please ensure that the model you are going to upload meets the following requirements:</p>

   <ol>
   <li>The object must be in a unity compatible format such as .obj</li>

   <li>The object needs to have a top layer (orange)</li>

   <li>The object needs to have exactly five slices (green) due to our limitations, with the names Slice<em>A, Slice</em>B, Slice<em>C, Slice</em>D and Slice_E. The slices will also be used for the <a href="#explode">explode-feature</a>. Otherwise, if this feature is not required or your model doesn’t meet a slices hierarchy just divide the objects under the Slices as in the example object. This will not have any effect on the calculation of the values or the visualisation.</li>

   <li>The Object needs exactly 18 pieces (blue). These pieces need to have the names as shown in the example. (A<em>1, A</em>2 ... E_3). Please divide your objects and name them accordingly.</li>
   </ol>

   <p><strong>Interaction with the pieces</strong> 
   Unity is based on physics. To allow the user to grab single pieces as shown in our example, each piece (A<em>1, A</em>2 ... E_3) has to have certain physics and scripts attached. Currently it is not possible to attach those scripts automatically during runtime due to a Unity problem. Therefore, if you wish to interact with the single pieces as shown in the following figure, you need to attach certain scripts to each of the 18 objects first. This step is optional, the environment works without those scripts and the objects can still be moved in total by using the pink handles of each object.</p>

   <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79250095/135018942-c07c7a2c-f387-47ff-af8d-d3b71e1cde6a.png" alt="SinglePiece" width="800px"/></p>

   <p>Follow these instructions to allow single piece interaction:</p>

This allows those devices to be treated like an Oculus Rift in wired mode to run the application on your local machine rather than on the device itself.  </p>
